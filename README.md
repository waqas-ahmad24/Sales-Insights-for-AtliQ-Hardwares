# Sales-Insights-for-AtliQ-Hardwares
Atliq Hardware, a leading computer hardware and peripheral manufacturing company headquartered in New Delhi, has been facing a significant challenge recently. Our Sales Director, Bhavin Patel, noticed a worrying trend of declining sales across various regions. However, identifying the root cause of this decline was an uphill battle. 

Whenever Bhavin asked the regional sales managers for reports, he was met with an overwhelming number of lengthy and complex Excel files. This made it extremely difficult to derive actionable insights at the ground level.

‚û° The Problem Statement:
Sales were declining, and the existing reporting process was too cumbersome for effective decision-making. Bhavin Patel needed a streamlined solution to quickly identify the underlying issues and make data-driven decisions.

‚û° My Approach to Solving This:
To tackle this problem, I leveraged Tableau to create an automated and dynamic solution that would transform the way sales data was analyzed at Atliq Hardware. Here‚Äôs how I approached the problem:

 ‚û° üîç Data Consolidation: Integrated data from multiple regional offices into a unified dashboard, eliminating the need for manual compilation of Excel files.
 
‚û° üìä Interactive Dashboards: Developed interactive Tableau dashboards that provided a clear view of sales performance across regions, product categories, and timeframes.
 
‚û° üöÄ Root Cause Analysis: Enabled Bhavin to drill down into specific regions and identify trends, bottlenecks, and underperforming segments with ease.
 
 ‚û° ‚öôÔ∏è Automation: Automated the data updating process, ensuring that the dashboards always reflected the most recent sales data without manual intervention.
 
‚û°üí° Actionable Insights: Delivered insights that helped Bhavin and his team pinpoint areas needing attention, such as specific underperforming stores or declining product categories.

The result? A clear, concise, and highly efficient reporting system that empowered the sales leadership to make informed decisions swiftly, contributing to a strategic turnaround in sales performance.
